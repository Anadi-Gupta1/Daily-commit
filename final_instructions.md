# Final Instructions to See Green Blocks

I've created 24 commits in your local repository, but we need to create the repository on GitHub before we can push them.

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Enter repository name: `github-green-blocks`
3. Make sure it's set to **Public**
4. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Commits
After creating the repository, run this command:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/DELL/Desktop/AWS/github-green-blocks
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- Username: Anadi-Gupta1
- Password: Your GitHub personal access token

## Step 3: Check Your Profile
After pushing, visit your GitHub profile:
https://github.com/Anadi-Gupta1

You should see green contribution blocks for today.

## Important Notes
1. Make sure your email "anadigupta55555@gmail.com" is verified on GitHub
2. It may take a few minutes for GitHub to update your contribution graph
3. The repository must be public for contributions to show by default

## Alternative: Create a New Repository with a Different Name
If you prefer, you can create a repository with a different name:

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Enter any repository name you prefer
3. Then run:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/DELL/Desktop/AWS/github-green-blocks
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Anadi-Gupta1/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```
