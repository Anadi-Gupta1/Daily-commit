To push your commits to GitHub and see the green blocks, you need to run this command:

git push -u origin main

When prompted, enter:
- Username: Anadi-Gupta1
- Password: Your GitHub personal access token (the one you shared earlier)

After pushing, visit your GitHub profile at:
https://github.com/Anadi-Gupta1

You should see green contribution blocks for today.

Note: If you don't see the green blocks immediately, it may take a few minutes for GitHub to update your contribution graph.

Important: Make sure your email "anadigupta55555@gmail.com" is verified on GitHub.
